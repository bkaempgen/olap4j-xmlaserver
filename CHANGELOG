* Problem: Apparently, since cube name pattern (restrictions) is a wildcard, a list of values is stored. Therefore,
when querying for cubes in xmla-server, I check whether restrictions is a list:

<pre>
				// Get cube manually
				Iterable<Cube> cubelist;
				// We have to consider that with xmla4js, this always is a list.
				String cubename;
				if (this.restrictions
						.get("CUBE_NAME") instanceof List) {
					List cuberestrictionlist = (List) this.restrictions
							.get("CUBE_NAME");
					cubename = cuberestrictionlist.get(0).toString();
				} else {
					cubename = this.restrictions
							.get("CUBE_NAME").toString();
				}
				if (cubename != null) {
					Cube mycube = schema.getCubes().get(
							cubename);
					ArrayList<Cube> newlist = new ArrayList<Cube>();
					newlist.add(mycube);
					cubelist = newlist;
				} else {
					cubelist = filter(sortedCubes(schema), cubeNameCond);
				}
</pre>

* xmla-server would not add proper restrictions to discover requests which would not allow olap4ld
to know the cube to query. (in RowsetDefinition).
